## Two ways to run it

**Locally over stdio** — the usual choice. Install from PyPI and point your
client at it with your own YNAB personal access token:

```bash
uv tool run mcp-ynab
```

**Or use the hosted instance** at `https://ynab.nyuchi.com/mcp`, a Cloudflare
Worker in front of a container running this same server. It speaks Streamable
HTTP and brokers YNAB OAuth, so a client that supports remote MCP can be
pointed at the bare URL and walked through "Sign in with YNAB":

```console
$ curl -s -D - -o /dev/null https://ynab.nyuchi.com/mcp
HTTP/2 401
www-authenticate: Bearer
```

**That `401` is correct, not a fault** — the endpoint is auth-gated, and a
compliant client discovers the flow at
`https://ynab.nyuchi.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (which returns
`200`). A `404` or a DNS failure would mean it is down.

Running it yourself is fully supported and documented under
[Remote deployment](#remote-deployment-cloudflare-container--worker); note that
`worker/wrangler.jsonc` is checked in with Nyuchi's own account id, KV
namespace and custom domain, so a fork must edit those.

## Features

- **53 tools** — budgets, accounts, transactions, categories, payees, months, scheduled transactions, analytics, and reconciliation
- **Delta sync** — only fetches what changed since the last call (uses YNAB's server knowledge)
- **4-tier caching** — TTL cache, delta sync, retry with backoff, SQLite persistence
- **Search & analytics** — text search across transactions, per-category spending breakdowns, Sankey flow data
- **Monthly reports with a live dashboard** — `get_monthly_report` returns income/spending summary, category and payee breakdowns, overspent categories, and a multi-month trend in one call. On hosts that support [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) (Claude, ChatGPT), it renders as an interactive dashboard (KPI tiles, charts, tables) automatically — no separate artifact step needed. On other hosts, the same data comes back as plain JSON.
- **Reconciliation** — `reconcile_account` compares an account's cleared transactions against a real-world statement balance, previews the adjustment and which transactions would be marked reconciled, and (once confirmed) applies it — the same workflow as YNAB's own "Reconcile" button. `export_transactions_csv` exports a register (any account, date range, cleared status) as CSV for reviewing against a statement.
- **Bulk operations** — create or update multiple transactions in a single call
- **Dollar amounts** — accepts dollars in parameters, converts to YNAB milliunits internally
- **Icons** — the server and every tool carry an on-brand icon (SEP for `icons`) for clients that render them

## Quick Start

```
uv tool run mcp-ynab
```

Requires a [YNAB personal access token](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer) set as `YNAB_API_KEY`.

### Field selection

Every tool that returns a model accepts an optional `exclude_fields` list. By
default each tool returns a sensible subset of fields to keep token usage low.
See [FIELDS.md](./FIELDS.md) for per-model defaults and override examples.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run server standalone
uv run python -m src.server
```

Requires `YNAB_API_KEY` in `.env.local` for running the server.

## Remote deployment (Cloudflare Container + Worker)

For connecting Claude web (or any client that needs a remote MCP server rather
than a local stdio process), `worker/` deploys the same Python server,
unchanged, behind a Cloudflare Container and a small routing Worker, on a
subdomain of your choosing — e.g. this fork's own instance runs at
`https://ynab.nyuchi.com/mcp`, but nothing below is tied to that
domain or account. Fork this repo, point the pieces below at your own domain
and Cloudflare account, and you have your own private remote instance.

The Python server itself just gained a second transport
(`src/server/http.py`, streamable-http instead of stdio); `worker/Dockerfile`
containerizes it, and `worker/src/index.ts` is a ~15-line Worker that forwards
requests into that container. Nothing about the stdio/Claude Desktop setup
above changes. (The Dockerfile lives under `worker/` rather than the repo
root, with `image_build_context: ".."` in `wrangler.jsonc` pointing the actual
build context back at the repo root — Cloudflare's Workers Builds
git-integration requires the Wrangler config and Dockerfile to share a root
directory, and this keeps both deploy paths below working from the same
layout.)

**Single-tenant vs. multi-tenant:** by default this deploys as a _single-tenant_
server — one `YNAB_API_KEY` secret for the whole deployment, gated by a
separate `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` shared secret. That's the right choice for a
private instance you're deploying just for yourself. If you want other
people to be able to use your deployment too — each with their own YNAB
budget, not yours — set `MCP_MULTI_TENANT=true` instead (see step 1 below):
there's then no `YNAB_API_KEY`/`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` at all, and each caller's
bearer token/`?token=` value _is_ their own [YNAB personal access
token](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer), used only for their own
requests. `src/server/http.py` keeps every caller's YNAB client, response
cache, and delta-sync state (a separate SQLite file per caller, under the
same cache directory) completely separate — nobody using a multi-tenant
deployment can see anyone else's budget, including yours. On top of that,
`worker/src/index.ts` routes each caller to their own container instance in
this mode (keyed by a hash of their token), so tenants also get independent
CPU/memory and each container sleeps on its own idle timer instead of
sharing one — one busy tenant can't keep another tenant's container running
(`containers[0].max_instances` in `wrangler.jsonc` caps how many can be
alive at once; raise it if you expect more concurrent users).

**Before your first deploy**, edit `worker/wrangler.jsonc` for your own setup:

- `name` — the Worker's name in your Cloudflare account. Whatever you pick
  here is also what you'll name the Worker in the dashboard (Option B below
  checks that the two match).
- `routes[0].pattern` — your own subdomain (e.g. `mcp.yourdomain.com`)
  instead of `ynab.nyuchi.com`. This repo declares it as a [Custom
  Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/)
  rather than a path-scoped [Route](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/),
  on the assumption that the Worker is the only thing on that subdomain —
  Cloudflare then manages the DNS record and certificate for it
  automatically, no DNS setup needed. If you'd rather share the subdomain
  with something else, switch this to a Route scoped to `/mcp*` instead.

**One-time setup:**

1. Decide single-tenant (default) or multi-tenant, and prepare the secrets
   for whichever you picked:
   - **Single-tenant:** generate a long random token for `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` —
     it's the only thing gating access to your YNAB data once the endpoint
     is public, e.g.:

     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```

     You'll set this and `YNAB_API_KEY` as secrets below.

   - **Multi-tenant:** nothing to generate — you'll set `MCP_MULTI_TENANT=true`
     as a secret below instead of `YNAB_API_KEY`/`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and each
     caller brings their own YNAB token.
   - **Multi-tenant + OAuth (optional, on top of the above):** lets a caller
     "Sign in with YNAB" instead of pasting a personal access token. Needs a
     [YNAB OAuth application](https://api.ynab.com/#oauth-applications) (redirect
     URI: `https://<your-domain>/oauth/ynab/callback`) and a Cloudflare KV
     namespace (`npx wrangler kv namespace create oauth`, then add the
     printed `id` to `wrangler.jsonc`'s `kv_namespaces` binding) for durable
     token storage, since the container's own disk doesn't survive an idle
     sleep. Set `YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` directly in
     `wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars` — neither is a credential (an OAuth client ID
     is meant to be public; an account ID is just an identifier), and putting
     them in source control means every deploy path carries them
     automatically instead of risking loss the way a versioned secret can
     when different deploy paths (a plain deploy, a gradual `versions
upload`/`deploy`, Workers Builds) clone from different version
     lineages. Set `YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLOUDFLARE_KV_API_TOKEN`
     (a token scoped to Workers KV Storage:Edit only — not your Cloudflare
     account token) as secrets below — those two are real credentials.
     Entirely additive: leaving these unset keeps the deployment on the
     PAT-only flow above. See `src/server/oauth.py`.
2. Requires a Workers **Paid** plan (Containers require it) and, for the
   Docker-build step below, either [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
   locally or Cloudflare's own build environment — pick one:

   **Option A — deploy from your machine:**

   ```bash
   cd worker
   npm install
   npx wrangler secret put YNAB_API_KEY              # single-tenant only
   npx wrangler secret put MCP_AUTH_TOKEN            # single-tenant only
   npx wrangler secret put MCP_MULTI_TENANT          # multi-tenant only — value: true
   npx wrangler secret put YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET  # OAuth only
   npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_KV_API_TOKEN   # OAuth only
   npm run deploy
   ```

   (Secrets aren't read from `wrangler.jsonc` — see the [Container secrets guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/examples/env-vars-and-secrets/).
   For OAuth, also edit `YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` into
   `wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars` directly — see the note above on why those two
   aren't secrets. `npm run deploy` builds the Astro site in `worker/site`
   first, then runs `wrangler deploy`, which builds the container image via
   your local Docker.)

   **Option B — connect your fork in the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers
   Builds), so it deploys automatically on every push to `main`:**
   1. Create a Worker with the same name you set in `worker/wrangler.jsonc`'s
      `"name"` field (they must match, or the build fails), then go to its
      **Settings → Builds → Connect** and pick your fork of this repo.
   2. Set **Root directory** to `worker` — Cloudflare's git-integration builds
      a Dockerfile only when it's under the configured root directory, which
      is why it lives at `worker/Dockerfile` rather than the repo root.
   3. Set **Build command** to `npm run build:site` — this builds the Astro
      landing page/privacy policy (`worker/site`) into `worker/site/dist`,
      which `wrangler.jsonc`'s `assets` binding serves; without this step the
      deploy command below would upload an empty (or stale) assets directory.
      Leave **Deploy command** as the default `npx wrangler deploy`.
   4. Set **Production branch** to `main` under **Settings → Builds**. Without
      this, Workers Builds deploys to _production_ off of every push to
      _every_ branch — including work-in-progress PR branches — rather than
      only after a merge to `main`. Leave **Builds for non-production
      branches** unchecked: its "Version command" runs from the repo root
      regardless of the Root directory setting above, so on this repo's
      layout it always fails with "Missing entry-point" — there's no
      per-branch override to fix that with. The equivalent check (does the
      Worker actually deploy cleanly) runs in CI instead, as the
      `worker-deploy-dryrun` job.
   5. Under the Worker's **Settings → Variables & Secrets**, add either
      `YNAB_API_KEY` and `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (single-tenant) or `MCP_MULTI_TENANT`
      set to `true` (multi-tenant) as secrets. For OAuth, add
      `YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLOUDFLARE_KV_API_TOKEN` as secrets here
      too — but edit `YNAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` into
      `wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars` instead of the dashboard, so they're versioned
      with your fork rather than living only in the dashboard.
   6. Push to `main` to trigger the first build — it can take several minutes
      while Cloudflare provisions the container image.

3. Connecting a client (**Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** in
   Claude web) — as of this writing, Claude.ai's custom connector UI only has
   fields for OAuth (Authorization/Token URL, Client ID/Secret), not a static
   header ([anthropics/claude-ai-mcp#112](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-ai-mcp/issues/112)),
   so the token travels as a `?token=` query parameter instead. `src/server/http.py`
   accepts either form; if you're adding this to a client that _does_ support
   custom headers (Claude Code, an MCP Inspector, etc.), prefer
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` there.
   - **Single-tenant:** `https://<your-domain>/mcp?token=<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`
   - **Multi-tenant:** `https://<your-domain>/mcp?token=<your-own-YNAB-personal-access-token>`
     — each person uses their own [YNAB personal access
     token](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer) here, not a value you hand out.
   - **Multi-tenant + OAuth:** if the OAuth secrets above are set, a client
     that _does_ support OAuth (Claude.ai's connector UI, for one) can instead
     be pointed at the MCP endpoint with no token in the URL at all — it
     discovers `https://<your-domain>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
     registers itself, and walks the caller through "Sign in with YNAB"
     directly. The plain `?token=` flows above still work unchanged either way.

The container's SQLite cache lives on ephemeral disk and rebuilds itself after
a cold start (same cache the stdio transport uses); nothing to configure
there. In multi-tenant mode this is one SQLite file per caller instead of
one shared file — created lazily the first time each caller's token is seen,
and bounded (oldest evicted) so a flood of distinct tokens can't grow it
unbounded. See `CLAUDE.md` for the day-to-day commands.

## Versioning

Releases follow the org versioning policy
([nyuchi/.github#80](https://github.com/nyuchi/.github/issues/80)). The
branch decides the bump, and there are no version labels:

- **A merge into `staging`** (the live beta) is tagged as the next
  **patch** automatically, by `staging-version.yml`.
- **A release to `main`** is the next **minor** above the highest tag. The
  PR that releases sets `version` in `pyproject.toml` to it. CI refuses any other version
  and names the right one.
- **A major** is only ever made by hand: the owner runs the release
  workflow from the Actions tab with `bump: major`.
- Each segment holds 0–999. Patch 999 rolls into the next minor; minor 999
  stops and asks for a manual major.

Versions released before 2026-10-04 are not renumbered.
